Software exploitation does not always imply running attacker-supplied binary
shellcode. A well-known example of "unexpected computation" are return-to-libc
and more general return-oriented programming. These recent papers [1, 2]
present two further ways to generate "weid machines" for software exploitation,
using ABI metadata and page faults, respectively.
